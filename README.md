# moodySer

Purpose: I needed an easy means to transfer files or texts from my PC to my mobile devices

# Building
I haven't made a build script yet (lazy) but realistically any C compiler on a UNIX system 
(i potentially used functions not existent in libc but exist in POSIX C Library) should work. 
Just pass the source files to the compiler

# To-Do(mostly for me)
- Add QR Code functionality
- Look into making it two-way
